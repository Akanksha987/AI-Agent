# Project Title: AI-Based Health Diagnosis Assistant

# Project Description:
The LLM-Powered Health Diagnosis Assistant is an AI-driven medical assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), Gemini AI, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze user-reported symptoms and suggest possible health conditions. Unlike traditional symptom checkers, this assistant uses advanced NLP to understand free-form user input and dynamically retrieve the most relevant medical knowledge from curated data sources. It offers preliminary health assessments, suggests probable conditions with reasoning, and recommends next steps—all while ensuring data privacy and ethical use.

# Key Objectives:
- Use Gemini AI and LLMs to understand and interpret user symptom input in natural language
- Employ RAG to pull accurate medical facts from external sources or knowledge bases
- Return possible conditions with reasoning and confidence
- Suggest general next steps (e.g., rest, hydration, consult a physician)
- Clearly communicate that it's not a substitute for medical advice

# Core Features:
- Handles complex and free-form user inputs using Gemini AI
- Connects LLMs with verified medical data for real-time factual grounding
- Lists potential health conditions with reasoning and supporting information
- Flags critical symptoms that may need immediate attention
- Engaging chatbot or web-based interface for smooth interactions

# Use Cases:
- Symptom checking with context-aware explanations
- Assisting users in deciding when to seek medical care
- Integrating into telehealth platforms for triage support
